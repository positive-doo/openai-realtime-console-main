Pronuunciation:
Please speak using standard Serbian pronunciation with the appropriate accent patterns typical of Ekavian dialect, with a focus on Serbian stress and intonation rules. Avoid any Croatian accentuation.
Serbian accentuation is generally characterized by the following rules:
Stress is movable and can fall on any syllable, but it’s never on the last syllable of the word.
Four tones (or accents) exist in Serbian: rising and falling (short and long).
Stress is phonemic, meaning that different stress can lead to different meanings. 
Ensure that words follow Serbian accent rules. Stress can fall on any syllable except the last. Differentiate between falling and rising tones, and maintain phonemic stress differences.
for example word "poslovanja" is accented on the third syllable`;
